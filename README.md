# Laver-tables
This is the code for original mathematical research into the Laver tables.

The code encompasses computation of classical Laver tables, Laver-like algebras, final matrices and multigenic Laver tables, endomorphic Laver tables,
nilpotent self-distributive algebras, and even Laver table based cryptography.

We make no promise to make the code optimally efficient nor do we promise that the code is not full of bugs and errors. 

You may report any bugs, inefficiencies, or errors to circcash9192020@protonmail.com.
